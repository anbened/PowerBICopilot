# Power BI Copilot
# A Practical Guide to What Copilot Sees, Understands, and Cannot Know

This repository hosts **practical, architecture-driven PDF documents** focused on **Copilot in Power BI**.

The purpose of this workspace is to provide **clear, honest, and technically grounded material** for architects, BI professionals, and decision makers who want to understand how Copilot really behaves in enterprise scenarios — beyond prompts, demos, or marketing narratives.

## Available documents

The repository currently includes the following documents:

- **PowerBI_Copilot_Whitepaper_EN.pdf**  
  English version of the whitepaper.  
  Intended for international teams, architects, and decision makers operating in enterprise and cross-country contexts.

- **PowerBI_Copilot_Whitepaper_IT.pdf**  
  Italian version of the same content.  
  Intended for Italian-speaking professionals and local enablement scenarios.

Both documents share the same structure and technical content, adapted linguistically for their respective audiences.

## What these documents cover

The material focuses on topics such as:

- What Copilot in Power BI actually does — and what it does not
- The central role of the **semantic model**
- Semantic ambiguity and its impact on AI-generated answers
- DAX, metadata, relationships, and linguistic modeling
- Governance concepts such as AI instructions, verified answers, and discoverability
- Practical limits, trade-offs, and architectural implications for enterprise adoption

The perspective is intentionally **architecture-first**: Copilot is treated as an **amplifier of the semantic model**, not as a replacement for modeling, governance, or analytical responsibility.

## What this repository is not

- It is not a collection of prompts
- It is not a feature-by-feature reference
- It is not a marketing or hype-driven narrative

All content is grounded in **real Power BI behavior**, current platform capabilities, and hands-on experience in enterprise environments.

## Intended audience

- Data & Analytics Architects
- BI / Analytics Engineers
- Power BI Modelers
- Technical Leads and Decision Makers
- Microsoft field and partner teams

A solid understanding of Power BI concepts (semantic models, DAX, governance) is assumed.

## How to use the material

You are welcome to:

- Read and reference the documents for personal learning
- Use them in internal enablement or customer conversations
- Share them with colleagues and teams
- Quote or adapt sections with proper attribution

Feedback, discussion, and constructive challenges are always welcome.
